# Trajectory-Based Continuous Collision Detection (T-CCD)

A simple 2D particle simulation that uses **Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)** to handle fast-moving particles. The simulation supports multiple detection methods (Cell List, Voxel Traversal, and Swept AABB), with options for reproducible seeding and CSV output of particle states and collision events.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to assess the effectiveness of an **experimental algorithm** (Spatial Partitioning + Voxel Traversal) compared to **traditional collision detection** (Swept AABB), in terms of both **performance** and **accuracy**.
